* Defination of bi tree
The bi tree have a left son and a righ son (which can be null)

a method fit bi tree node will fit its sons

** balanced bi tree
the hight of a node's two sonless than 1
** ideal balanced bi tree
** full bi tree
** complete bi tree
it's easy to save a complete bi tree in a array, but for a random tree you must full it with empty node which will take up disk sapce.
and there is also a LNode save space unalloced

so we write it by LNode you can save three pointer in it point to parents and sons.
** foreach bi tree
first foreach right left sons
and do for root node 

* save and design method for a tree(not a bi tree)
